# Adevent of Code 2021

So this is my collection of code for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
Expect hacky code that is not representative of my average code quality.

Python solutions take input from `stdin`, so run like this:

```shell
$ cat input1.in | python3 3.py
```

Swift solutions take the filename as the first argument.

```shell
$ swift ./AoC1/main.swift input1.in
```
